I require no introduction so I will just write about the technologies I'm learning and working with:

- **C#** - good for software and web development; the first serious programming language I've learned
- **Rust** - awesome in general but especially for CLI, quick prototyping, and robust error handling
- **Zig** - good replacement for the good old C. apparently quicker than Assembly...
- **Haskell** - a really hard purely functional language to think differently. prototyping in it feels exceptionally quick

I would also like to learn: **Go**, **OCaml**, **PHP** (THEY SAY IT HAS IMPROVED, OK? plus never tried it), and **more I will add...**

**Note:** if any of this information is outdated, as it very much may be, sorry.
